When responding to disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes,  emergency workers have the critical task of being able to identify where survivors are located in order to quickly and accurately send assistance. 
Given the rapid growth in wireless technology and the increasing likelihood that people all across the globe have a cell phone we want to attempt to tap into this technology in such a way that we can use social media posts asking for help and assistance to track survivors.
Social media can provide valuable information about the specifics of a disaster such as downed power lines, flooding streets, spread and location of wildfire, density of smoke etc. Additionally it can help identify isolated communities at risk, locations of survivors and areas where assistance teams should be sent for search and rescue, levels of damage, help map depths of flooding, identify where additional imagery/information needs to be collected and plan when and where resources should be allocated.
Here we attempted to specifically engage with the Twitter API in order to create tools that would allow us to geolocate people in need and/or areas in need of assistance and/or areas that should be avoided. The desired tools would have the ability to help locate problems regardless of the type of disaster.
